## Features

## Getting Started

### Installation

To use the navigation component in your project, follow these steps:

1. Download the repository as a ZIP file or clone it using the following command:

   ```bash
(https://github.com/abdul-1432/ja-15_Navigation/edit/main/README.md)
   ```

2. Copy the necessary files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to your project directory.

### Usage

To add the navigation component to your website, follow these steps:

1. Include the required CSS and JavaScript files in the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

   ```HTML
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/navigation-component.css">
   <script src="path/to/navigation-component.js"></script>
   ```

2. Create a navigation container element in your HTML file, usually within the `<header>` section:

   ```HTML
   <header>
     <nav id="navigation">
       <!-- Navigation links go here -->
     </nav>
   </header>
   ```

3. Customize the navigation links and styling by modifying the HTML and CSS files, or by adding your own styles.

4. Initialize the navigation component by calling the `initNavigation()` function:

   ```javascript
   <script>
     document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
       initNavigation();
     });
   </script>
   ```

   The `initNavigation()` function will add interactivity to the navigation links and handle any necessary functionality, such as dropdown menus.
